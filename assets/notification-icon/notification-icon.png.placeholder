# This is a placeholder for the notification icon
# You'll need to replace this with actual PNG files:
# - notification-icon.png (24x24 pixels)
# - notification-icon@2x.png (48x48 pixels) 
# - notification-icon@3x.png (72x72 pixels)

# For now, you can use any small PNG file as a placeholder
# The icon should be white/transparent design that will be tinted pink by Android
