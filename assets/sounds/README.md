# Notification Sounds

This folder contains custom notification sounds for the Glowgetter app.

## Files:
- `notification.mp3` - Custom girly notification sound for appointments

For now, we'll use a placeholder. In a real app, you would:
1. Create a custom sound file (MP3/WAV)
2. Or use royalty-free sounds from freesound.org
3. Or generate sounds programmatically

The app will fall back to system notification sound if custom sound is not available.
